          My name is <strong>Jakub Sulisz</strong>. I'm a junior Full Stack
          Developer with a strong focus on React. I recently graduated from an
          intensive web development program at DCI Berlin, where I gained a
          solid foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies.

        <p>
          I'm now looking to take my first professional steps in the IT
          industry. I'm eager to join a team where I can continue learning, grow
          my skills, and contribute to meaningful and challenging projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of coding, I enjoy reading books, following geopolitics and
          history. In my free time, I also play video games and occasionally
          paint. I like combining creativity with analytical thinking, both in
          my hobbies and in how I approach development.
